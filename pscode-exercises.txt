// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

num divisible by 2
num not divisible by 2

Ask for a num divisible
Ask for a number not divisible
Print result for divisible num
Print result for not divisible num

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Pseudocode
a)Print "Enter 5 numbers"
b)sum to number1 + number2 + number3 + number4 + number5
average to sum / 5
C)Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
If number2 < min Then
    Set min to number2
  If number3 < min Then
    Set min to number3
  If number4 < min Then
    Set min to number4
  If number5 < min Then
    Set min to number5

  Set max to number1
  If number2 > max Then
    Set max to number2
  If number3 > max Then
    Set max to number3
  If number4 > max Then
    Set max to number4
  If number5 > max Then
    Set max to number5

Print "The average of the numbers is: " + average
Print "The smallest number is: " + min
Print "The largest number is: " + max
